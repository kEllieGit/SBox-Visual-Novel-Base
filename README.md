# S&Box Visual Novel Base (VNBase)

VNBase is a library for creating visual novels or dialogue systems for S&Box Games.

Scripts are written using a LISP-styled language called VNScript, a user-friendly DSL (Domain-Specific Language) designed for building VNBase scripts with ease.

## Showcase

Below is a video showcase of a simple example project made with VNBase.
